      "Hello Anon Ducks! I started off strong and now I just feel like my brain is turning into an assorted pile of over-boiled mashed potato and over-steamed vegetable. I have spent so long delivering lectures on the best way to make toad in the hole with bananas instead of sausages and it is all I have known for most of my adult life. Suddenly, my banana toad in the hole is irrelevant! And I have got props coming out my this, and callbacks coming out my that, and my ears are bleeding javascript! How are you guys coping with this sudden and beautiful change in your daily lives? Much love, Other Anon Duck",
